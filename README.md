### Technical Background
Mainly writting C for my undergraduate degree as a computer engineer, mostly worked on embedded system


### Team Project
We are making a library search engine, which would help student to find free source of textbooks and lower their tuition cost. We plan to work with open-source library database and allow people surf the website do simple book searching, view the abstract. If they decide to save the books, then they need to create an account and save the books in their favorite list. When they are done with the books, they can always leave a review for the book for others to see.
